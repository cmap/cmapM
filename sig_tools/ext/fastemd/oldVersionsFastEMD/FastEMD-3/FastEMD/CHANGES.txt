Version 1.1
-----------
Addition of compiled binaries.

Version 2
---------
1. Changed "emd_hat_metric" to "emd_hat_gd_metric", as the only needed
   condition for its usage is that the ground distance is a metric
   (there is no need for alpha to be >=1/2, that is there is no need for
   the resulting emd_hat to be a metric). 
2. double support and change of C++ interface to templates structs
   with operator().
3. Functions now can return the flow.
4. Java wrapper.
5. Changes in demos, including the addition of demo_FastEMD4/ which
   shows how to compare two not necessarily equal-size images using
   state of the art color distance (ciede2000) and emd_hat.
6. Fixed a bug in the signatures interface.

Version 2.1
-----------
Changed license to BSD.

Version 2.2
-----------
Added windows 64 version library compiled for the java interface (thanks to Erik Nooijen).

Version 3
---------
Added version of non-symmetric ground distance and non-equal sized histograms/signatures.
