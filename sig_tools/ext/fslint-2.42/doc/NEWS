		* Allow the findup script to run on CYGWIN by handling the
		  different output format of md5sum et. al. on that platform.
		* The "Bad IDs" function in the GUI would error out if it found
		  any items.  This regression was introduced in 2.26.
		* Start the GUI even if the user's locale is not supported

	* Improvements:
		* Add a context menu item to "Open Folder" that contains
		  the selected file. Suggestion from Scott Kostyshak.
		* Ask for confirmation, if all copies of a duplicate
		  are selected for deletion. Suggestion from Endolith.
		* Add Pause/Resume buttons to control long searches.
		  Suggestion from Scott Kostyshak.
		* In the "empty directories" tab, report empty branches rather
		  than just empty leaf directories. Suggestion from Endolith.

2.26 20/05/08
	* Translations:
		* Added: Czech, Turkish.
		* Updated: French, German, Malay.
	* Fixes:
		* Don't ignore duplicate files with '\' chars in the path.
		  This issue was reported by Andrew U. Frank.
		* Don't abort reporting duplicates if the GUI can't process
		  a particular file. This issue was reported by Andrew U. Frank.
		* When finding dupes, handle \f\r\v characters within filenames,
		  rather than displaying an exception.
		* Use and document better syntax for excluding paths.
		* Honour/sanitize user specified wildcards for excluding paths.
		* Tweak "fix whitespace" script to run on dash (ubuntu).
		* Allow cli scripts to run from paths containing whitespace.
		* Fix erroneous reordering of certain find command parameters.
	* Improvements:
		* Make file deletion much easier by supporting the 'Delete' key,
		  auto removing groups from display when only 1 item remaining,
		  giving the option to not confirm every delete operation and
		  not resetting column widths on every delete operation.
		* When we auto select packages for deletion due to dependencies,
		  group all selected packages together for easier review.
		* Indicate using the mouse pointer that the application is busy,
		  during the possibly long cleaning/deleting/merging processes.
		* Exclude more commonly aliased binaries when searching
		  for conflicting program names in the $PATH.

2.24 19/09/07
	* Translations:
		* Added: Hewbrew, Italian, Russian.
		* Updated: Chinese (simplified), French, German,
		  Swedish, Vietnamese.
	* Fixes:
		* Make the GUI handle paths with spaces in names of empty dirs,
		  and spaces at the end of names of duplicate files.
		* Make the "within groups" selection sub menu respond to
		  not just right click, after clicking the "Select" button.
		  This issue was reported by Andrew U. Frank.
		* Ensure the GUI honours all "directories to exclude".
		  Previously directories with a trailing / were ignored.
		* Fix the packing of a few of the GUI widgets, so that
		  all "action" buttons are the same size, and to allow the app
		  window to be resized smaller than was previously possible.
		* Remove brace expansion from debian/rules to allow package
		  to build on debian systems where dash is the default shell.
		* Fixed a bug reintroduced in 2.22 (GUI only) where duplicates
		  with independent hardlinks were not reported correctly.
		* Rename findup --sizes option to the more accurate --summary.

2.22 28/06/07
	* Translations:
		* Added: Spanish.
		* Updated: Danish.
	* Improvements:
		* Ensure all numbers are output appropriate to locale.
		* Add an indenting checker/fixer to the "redundant whitespace"
		  function. This checks for erroneous mixing of tabs and spaces
		  in the indenting at the start of a line, and the user
		  can select to fix with tabs or spaces.
		* Set mouse pointer to "busy interactive" during searches.
		  This makes it more obvious that work is progressing and that
		  only parts of the GUI will be responsive.
		* Simplify the default output from the findup CLI tool, to make
		  it easier to pipe. Use the --sizes option to get old format.
		* Add a "rename" function for paths. To activate: Select a path
		  in a list and hit F2 or right click and select Rename...
		* Add a "copy path to clipboard" function for paths.
		  To activate: Select a path in a list, and hit Ctrl-C or
		  right click and select Copy.
		* Support a G_FILENAME_ENCODING which is different to the
		  default character encoding.
	* Fixes:
		* Change duplicate file merging algorithm to be more robust in
		  rare error conditions, to eliminate any chance of data loss.
		* Remove the cross device restriction from `findup -m`.
		* Position dialogs correctly over the FSlint window,
		  and also don't leak the dialog memory.
		* Change popup (selection) menu so that it (dis)appears
		  in response to more standard user events. This issue was
		  identified by Bruce Byfield.
		* Ignore paths (indirectly) specified multiple times.
		  This would cause duplicate file merging to break
		  resulting in a file being deleted and not linked to a copy.
		* Handle paths containing '\n' characters.
		  Previously this would cause various errors to be output.
		  Bug report from Bjørn Ingmar Berg.

2.20 09/03/07
	* Translations:
		* Updated: Danish.
	* Packaging changes:
		* Really support building SuSE specific RPMs from the tarball.
		  Previously I used the "Application" category which is fedora
		  specific. I now use only freedesktop standard categories.
		* Fix minor lintian warning in debian/control file.
		* Updated package descriptions so it's easier to find in repos.
	* Improvements:
		* Reduce CPU usage by 35% when finding dups.
		* Handle large, same sized files with differing content
		  more efficiently, when finding dups.

2.18 25/12/06
	* Translations:
		* Added: Danish.
		* Updated: Swedish.
	* Fixes for finding/merging duplicates across multiple filesystems:
		* Fix a bug introduced in 2.15 wrt the independent hardlinks
		  fix. The bug was essentially that duplicates would only be
		  found within one filesystem of the specified search path(s).
		  Note this bug only affects systems with findutils >= 4.2
		  This bug was reported and fixed by Robert Seczkowski.
		* Make disk head seeks more efficient when finding duplicates,
		  in the case where multiple filesystems on the same physical
		  disk are being checked.
		* When merging duplicates using hardlinks, and those duplicates
		  are on different filesystems, use symlinks rather than just
		  deleting the files.
	* Packaging changes:
		* Support building SuSE specific RPMs from the tarball.
		* Simplify debian package so that it builds with dash.
		* Add gentoo ebuild from Cédrick Gaillard to web site.
	* GUI improvements:
		* Give updating "searching...." status, to ensure that users
		  know the program is still running.
		* Give an explanation in status field for each function (tab).
		* Enable a default button for all dialogs (when enter pressed).
		* Provide a menu to greatly enhance the selection functionality.
		  This was prompted by feedback from Rolf Leggewie.
		* Display all errors from an operation, not just the last.
		* Display any errors from "save results" operation.

2.16 02/07/06

	* Fix bug introduced in 2.15 where no paths would ever be
	  reported in "Invalid UTF8 mode".
	* Fix bug where we always reported 0 space wasted by temp files.
	* Fix bug where we left processes running if we exited the GUI
	  while a search was running. This was reported by Christoph Haas.
	* Support building mandriva specific RPMs from the tarball.
	* Added a man page for fslint and fslint-gui.
	* Some debian package fixups suggested by lintian.
	* Some rpm package changes to align with the debian package.

2.15 20/04/06

	* General cleanups suggested by Justin Pryzby,
	  particularly in relation to debian packaging.
	* Fixed a bug where if one specified a directory containing
	  a space in the name then none of the tools could handle it.
	  This was reported by Chris Tasma.
	* Fixed a bug where duplicates with independent hardlinks
	  were not merged correctly. This was reported by Gersom van de Bunt.
	* Fixed a bug where the -m option to findup could only be
	  the last parameter. This was reported by Gersom van de Bunt.
	* Fixed a bug where all scripts were broken if started with a
	  relative path and a single directory was passed as a parameter.
	  This was reported by Gersom van de Bunt.

2.14 20/02/06

	* Added transations: Malay, Chinese (simplified).
	* Added package management functionality for deb and rpm distros.
	  One can list/sort all packages, and delete selected packages with
	  full dependency analysis.
	* Support calling the command line tools from any directory,
	  so for example adding /usr/share/fslint/fslint to the $PATH now works.
	  Note the GUI is now invoked with the `fslint-gui` command and
	  the command line version with the `fslint` command.
	* Changed the complexity of saving results from O((n/2)*(n+1)) to O(n).
	  This was caused by GtkCList inefficiencies and reported by
	  Stefan Westerfeld.
	* Created a debian package, which hopefully should work on,
	  debian, ubuntu, xandros, ... I only tested on ubuntu breezy.
	* Fixed bug in the GUI where one couldn't cancel a find operation with
	  the keyboard, if the caps lock or num lock were enabled.
	* Fixed bug in findnl where it would always flag non ascii alphanumeric
	  chars as problematic.
	* Fixed bug in GUI where multiline errors were displayed on one line.
	* Change default GUI size from 640x480 to 800x600.
	* Correctly remove references to deprecated gtk.{TRUE,FALSE} while
	  staying compatible with python versions prior to 2.2.1.

2.12 31/08/05

	* Make disk usage calculation more efficient/robust.
	* Add findu8 util (exposed in "Bad names" tab in GUI),
	  which reports file or directory names with an invalid UTF8 encoding.
	* Don't fall back to Latin-1 for character representations.
	  Instead display replacement char for non ascii.
	* Convert control characters to their corresponding
	  unicode control pictures for display.
	* Change from deprecated gtk.FALSE to False.
	* Make disk head seeks even more efficient by sorting by inodes rather
	  than by path name when finding duplicates and non stripped binaries.
	* Double check (with sha1) md5 duplicates found, to make
	  sure we don't get any false positives.

2.11 18/03/05

	* Fix for internally generated error messages not being displayed.
	  This bug was introduced in 2.10.

2.10 15/03/05

	* Added translations: Vietnamese, Swedish.
	* Now handle non utf8 file and directory names in GUI.
	* Removed colouring of buttons and error text,
	  as colours mean different things to different cultures.
	* Now doesn't remember selected directory if the dialog is canceled.
	* Changed status and list widgets to entry and textview respectively,
	  so that one can copy and paste, status and error output.
	* Changed deprecated funtions as reported by pygtk2-2.4.0.
	* Implemented a findnl portability improvement suggested by Paul Eggert.
	* Updated docs with input from Helge Hielscher and Fab Mueller.

2.08 17/06/04

	* Added translation: Brazilian Portuguese.
	* Fixed major bug where the GUI was grossly inefficient
	  when reading data from the subordinate text tools.
	* Fixed all text tools when if one file specified it would be ignored.
	* Tiny update to french translation.

2.06 23/04/04

	* Added translations: French, Serbian (cyrillic).

2.04 19/11/03

	* Added translations: Dutch, Irish.
	* Fixed a few missing translations in the code.
	* Incorporated some of the packaging changes from Ville Skyttä
	  <ville.skytta at iki.fi> that he did while creating the fedora rpm.
	* Gave all result lists a border for consistency.
	* Tidied search abort code, so confusing status/error not given,
	  also Return key can now abort.

2.02 28/07/03

	* Added language translation support (and translations for
	  German, Romanian).
	* Handle keypresses while search is running so that user can
	  abort using the keyboard {space,Ctrl-C,Esc}, and also other
	  parts of the gui can't be activated.
	* Allow user to select files to exclude from merging of duplicates.
	* Some small code optimizations and cleanups.
	* Fix crash bug on startup for invalid locales.
	* Tried to make the GUI a little more obvious by seperating
	  the "find/stop" button from the other "action" buttons.

2.01 26/03/03

	* Added stop button, yay!
	* Handled case where program would deadlock if backend scripts
	  wrote more than 1 buffer size to stderr (4K on Linux).
	* Optimized the cleaning of redundant whitespace and fixed buglet
	  where space was counted as saved even if the file was unwriteable.
	* Fixed bug in findtf where core files wouldn't have been found on
	  some (newer) systems.
	* Made the dialog boxes clearer/prettier.
	* Handle invalid search paths given on command line appropriately.

2.00 20/01/03

	* Upgraded to gtk2 & python2 (hence the version jump).
	  N.B. This is not backwards compatabile with python1.5 or gtk1.
	* python2 allowed fixing a bug where the size (in blocks used)
	  of some duplicate files was underestimated by 1 block.
	* Now use explicit LC_CTYPE=C in all tools as I noticed huge
	  performance degradation in sort (with redhat 8 patches) when UTF8
	  was in LANG or LC_CTYPE.
	* Revert bug introduced in findrs in V1.20 regarding : in filenames.
	* Changed all usage of sort of form -k5n to -k5,5n which is better.
	* Change error pane so it does not resize and main output pane does.
	* GUI now takes search paths as an option on the command line.
	* Tidied summary of duplicate groups in GUI.
	* Updated the docs.

1.22 27/03/03

	* support python 2

1.21 06/01/03

	* Allow to exclude paths that match a (glob) pattern,
	  in addition to specific paths.
	* Fix bug where you weren't able to delete (empty) directories.
	* Fix version reported by GUI to 1.21 (from 2.00).
	* Reformat all lines to < 80 chars.
	* Added a FAQ.

1.20 16/12/02

	* A GUI AT LAST! Implemented in python (>1.5), libglade and gtk (1.2).
	* A standard install procedure (rpm).
	* All tools now support piping to stdout in easily parseable format.
	* Reverted to previous implementation of findid, as the built-in
	  -no{user,group} in find is much slower. This really shows the power
	  of small cohesive utils over monolithic architectures.
	* Cleaned up fstool/dupwaste.
	* Cleaned up fixdup.{sh,py} (mostly to mirror GUI).
	* findsn and findbl now take -A param instead of -a
	  (so there is no overlap with find).
	* findsn now outputs in grouped mode (newline between each group)
	  by default. This puts a requirement on the new uniq which is
	  part of textutils-2.0.21 or any coreutils. When piping output
	  \0 is used to delimit rather than \n.
	* findtf has a new --age=x parameter. Previously you could only
	  specify the age in core file mode, and also it used atime (in an
	  incorrect way). Now it uses mtime correctly.
	* zipdir now works on ext3 and also checks for presence of cpio before
	  preceeding. Both enhancements were suggested by Jan (Honza) Fikar.
	* findrs can now handle filenames with : in them.

1.14 27/09/02

	* In the new findid tool there were 3 bugs (pointed out by
	  tido at hushmail.com). 1. The regular expression was missing
	  a trailing colon. 2. ls was missing a -b option (to escape
	  non printable chars. 3. find actually has -no{user,group}
	  options which would be better to use (making a lesser but
	  still valid requirement for the findid script).
	* Added -b option to ls in findul and findns in case libraries
	  or executables have non printable characters in their names.
	* Small performance enhancement to findnl (too many tr's started).
	* Spell checked this file for some reason :-).

1.13 25/09/02

	* Enhanced the fslint script so findsn and findns print more
	  useful information when you analyse the whole system (/).
	* Added new tool (findid) to report files that have invalid uid or gid.
	* Added -d option to findup which is like -m except it deletes
	  all but one duplicate file rather than merging using hard-links.
	* Added -t option to findup so that it only reports changes
	  that would result from -d or -m.
	* small comment update to findsn and whitespace cleanup to this file.

1.12 27/02/02

	* Feck, forgot to update the version reported since V1.08!
	* Greatly reduce possible /tmp races in findul.
	  Patch from Anthony D. Urso.
	* Added suspect link checking to main fslint script.
	* Documented fixdup more, and made it explicit/consistent in
	  how it handles blank lines as input.
	* Changed default mode of findrs to only report file names,
	  which is quicker. Added a new parameter (-c) to count the
	  number of lines with redundant whitespace as was done previously.
	* Some small comment and test updates.

1.11 11/02/02

	* Added a new mode to findup, which merges (using hard-links)
	  any found duplicate files (-m).
	* Finally added suspect link checking to findbl (-s).
	* Added a "number of days old a core file has to be" option
	  to findtf (-c[days]).
	* Usual small comments and cleanups.

1.10 08/01/02

	* Added a new tool (findul) to report possible unused libraries,
	  on the system.
	* Changed the field specifiers to sort in the various tools, to
	  use the -kx.. option instead of the deprecated +x.. style.
	* The argument handling "fixes" applied in the previous version
	  had problems where findnl & zipdir ignored all passed parameters,
	  all tools had to have the global parameters (-r & -f at present)
	  specified before any others, and there were various issues when
	  no parameters were passed. This should all be fixed now.
	* Removed the bash dependency (declare) from getfpf.
	  Marc A. Lehmann reported this.
	* Got rid of spurious 0 output by findrs when it had no files to report.
	* The usual extra comments and code cleanups.

1.09 25/08/01

	* Added better core file checking to findtf (-c). It now does
	  more thorough checking and prints more information about
	  the core files it finds.
	* Removed the perl dependency (1 line from findbl!). I rewrote
	  it in shell (again 1 line).
	* I cleaned up the argument handling of the various tools as
	  it was quite silly really. Eivind Kjørstad prompted me to fix it.
	* Handled the special case of the redhatism /usr/bin/consolehelper
	  which gave "false" positives for conflicting binaries (reported
	  by the default mode of findsn).
	* Added an extra (albeit esoteric) check to "findbl -n".
	* Updated/fixed a few comments.

1.08 16/08/01

	* Enhanced getffp so that duplicate entries in a users $PATH
	  are handled correctly, and also common binary directories
	  are always searched. This enhances findsn and findns.
	* Updated zipdir so that it doesn't process ext2 mount points.
	* Cleaned up all files so that they are <= 80 chars wide.
	* Handled case in findsn where files with \n's in the name
	  would cause erroneous output.
	* Fixed (removed) silly argument handling in fslint script.

1.07 17/07/01

	* Fixed default mode of findsn which reports redundant or
	  conflicting files in the $PATH. Previously it was reporting
	  hard-linked files with the same name as problematic which
	  was wrong. Also it now handles symlinks and is therefore
	  much more powerful.
	* Added aliases check to findsn (-a).
	* Added a new zipdir utility that reclaims wasted blocks in
	  ext2 directories (ext2 doesn't auto shrink directories).
	* Updated the help text for findsn as it was confusing.
	* Removed the 2 binaries from the findns test directory as
	  they were just a waste of space really.
	* Fixed a bug in findrs where it would miss some text files.
	* Slight update to findbl help text.
	* Fixed bug in getffp where it specified file types and also
	  tidied it's documentation a little.
	* Removed the silly find version checking stuff from findup.
	* Added --version option to all utilities.
	* General documentation cleanups.

1.06 05/02/01

	* Added new name case portability check to findsn (-c).
	* Updated the fslint script with the code above and also
	  made a couple of cosmetic changes.
	* Added POSIX.1 filename portability checks to findnl (-p).
	* Added ignore case option (-C) to findsn.
	* Fixed $PATH handling bugs in findns (same as I done for findsn
	  in the previous release). I created a script (getffp) that
	  is called by both. Note this script can be called by any of
	  the utilities, for e.g. findup `getffp`.
	* Changed output from findns (find Non Stripped executables) to
	  order the found executables by size.
	* Removed device file from test directory as this caused
	  problems when extracting.
	* changed all usage of source to include scripts to use
	  the . syntax, to remove the dependency on bash.
	* Tidied tar archive so that no users/group info is included.

1.05 28/01/01

	* Updated the fslint script with the new tools released
	  in V1.02 and 1.04.
	* Added new check to redundant links for checking for links (to
	  directories) with trailing /'s
	* Fixed $PATH handling bugs in findsn where links and invalid entries
	  would cause problems.
	* Tidied tstlnt directories a little.
	* Updated documentation a little.

1.04 12/12/00

	* Corrected errors in the documentation of the 1.03 changes below.
	* Added check for uniq -D support to findsn.
	* Changed findsl (stale links) to findbl (bad links), and added
	  more options to find different forms of lint in symbolic links.
	* Added --help (or -h) to all scripts.
	* Renamed the test directories to something more sensible.
	* Renamed findts to findrs.
	* Added a check to findnl for names with trailing .'s.
	* Added a check to findtf for .pure files (purify remains).

1.03 09/12/00

	* Changed findns (non stripped binaries) so it defaults
	  to looking in the $PATH if no dirs/files specified.
	* Changed findsl to run output through ls so the broken
	  target of the stale links is shown.
	* Tidied up the tstlnt directories so findup can be run from
	  the base installation directory without finding loads of
	  duplicates in various places. This also saved disk space.
	* Changed this log format so it can be correctly processed
	  by txt2html.

1.02 04/12/00

	* Documentation changes.
	* New tool (findsn (find duplicate names)).
	* New test in findnl to report files/dirs with more that 2
	  adjacent spaces in the name.
	* Fixed ambiguities in ls parameters in various scripts.

1.01 16/11/00

	* Doug quale reported buglet in findup where it broke
	  for files starting with -. His suggested fix was to add
	  a -- option to the md5sum command.

1.00 14/11/00

	* Initial release.
