New widgets to try are (grouped) GtkClist -> Gtk{TreeView,Model}

Use checkboxes within package list to mark a package for deletion,
rather than selecting the whole row. This is much easier to code for
and will allow the user to easily sort by selection state also.
In addition we would autosort by this selection state when packages are
automatically selected for deletion through dependency analysis,
so that users could easily review the updated selection.

This (small) limitation is hard to fix but since $# (the number of params)
is checked for in findsn, you can't do stuff like:
findsn -A -name "python*"
Would need to check no paths specified (I.E. like what getfpf does).

would be good to merge hardlinked files in findns
