mtoc++ is designed as a filter for Mat\+Lab m-\/files, so that they can be processed by doxygen as if they were C source files. Everything else regarding tags, conventions and possible formatting of display is completely defined by Doxygen. So, unless explicitly explained as \char`\"{}feature\char`\"{} of mtoc++ here, one should look into Doxygen\textquotesingle{}s \href{http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual.html}{\tt documentation pages} first before complaining about some stuff that mtoc++ surprisingly cannot do.

Check out the \hyperlink{tools_tools_direct}{Using mtoc++ directly} section for details on how mtoc++ works.\hypertarget{troubleshooting_ts_path}{}\subsection{Issues finding binaries (\+M\+A\+C)}\label{troubleshooting_ts_path}
Thanks to a report from K. Kearney to resolve path issues on M\+A\+C platforms\+:

"After building, I added {\ttfamily } $<$mydir$>$/mtoc++\+\_\+1.4/tools to my Matlab path and tried to run Mac\+Doc\+Maker.\+setup. I encountered an issue where Matlab couldn\textquotesingle{}t locate either mtocpp or latex. I think this is a Mac-\/specific issue; when you start Matlab in the standard way, from the Dock (rather than through the command-\/line matlab command), the shell it starts doesn\textquotesingle{}t run any configuration scripts (.bashrc, .back\+\_\+profile, etc) or set system paths. I think some versions of Matlab have a .matlabrc.\+sh file that can be modified to set a P\+A\+T\+H, and I\textquotesingle{}ve seen something on the newsgroup about .plist files, but I just force the Matlab shell it to match my other Terminal sessions by adding the following lines to the top of the matlab shell script ($<$matlabroot$>$/bin/matlab)\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
source ~/.bash\_profile
source /etc/bashrc
source /etc/profile
\end{DoxyCode}


With that change (and after restarting Matlab), I was able to successfully run \hyperlink{class_matlab_doc_maker_a434c176c2421dd18a40003919b19f4f2}{Matlab\+Doc\+Maker.\+setup}, and then \hyperlink{class_matlab_doc_maker_a278883e6b83f6c6e7780e0d567dee119}{Matlab\+Doc\+Maker.\+create} on a test directory."\hypertarget{troubleshooting_ts_debug}{}\subsection{Debugging mtoc++}\label{troubleshooting_ts_debug}
For hard cases like segfaults there is also hope!

You can build your mtoc++ binaries with the {\ttfamily Debug} build type (starting in the source folder)\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Debug ..
make
\end{DoxyCode}
 Then, send the compiled binaries along with the used source code to us and we will try to figure out what the heck is wrong with it!
