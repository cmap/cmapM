/* (Autoinserted by mtoc++)
 * This source code has been filtered by the mtoc++ executable,
 * which generates code that can be processed by the doxygen documentation tool.
 *
 * On the other hand, it can neither be interpreted by MATLAB, nor can it be compiled with a C++ compiler.
 * Except for the comments, the function bodies of your M-file functions are untouched.
 * Consequently, the FILTER_SOURCE_FILES doxygen switch (default in our Doxyfile.template) will produce
 * attached source files that are highly readable by humans.
 *
 * Additionally, links in the doxygen generated documentation to the source code of functions and class members refer to
 * the correct locations in the source code browser.
 * However, the line numbers most likely do not correspond to the line numbers in the original MATLAB source files.
